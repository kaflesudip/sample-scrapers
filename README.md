# sample-scrapers
A few sample bots and scrapers. Most of the scrapers are written in Python. I mostly use requests, mechanize, selenium, scrapy and beautifulsoup.

## Running the scraper/ bot.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Browse to the corresponding directory and modify `config_sample.py` as required. Save it as config.py
4. Run the scraper or crawler.

## Other projects / Scrapers:

	1. Scraping of Top 10 beauty sites in UK - https://github.com/kaflesudip/BeautyProductsScraping

### Python environment
The scrapers are written in Python3 unless or otherwise specified in their corresponding directory.
